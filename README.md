During an online practical training in my first year, I created this basic ecommerce website having:<br /> 1. an attractive front page<br /> 2. books divided into multiple categories<br /> 3. bootstrap carousel to display books<br /> 4. dedicated products page for each book<br /> 5. Buy now button that redirects user to address page<br /> 6. Address page with HTML form that collects user's address and stores in
google sheets<br /> 7. Form validation using javascript<br />
<br />
As of now, it is just made up of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. I'll
later add new functionalities in it like: <br /> 1. More attractive and user-friendly UI<br /> 2. Data collection using MongoDB<br /> 3. Dynamically adding new books in the front page<br /> 4. Dynamically creating the products pages of each book <br /> 5. Using React's components structure to reduce work in manually making
multiple web pages<br /> 6. Enhanced payment options using GPay, PayTM, RazorPay.<br /> 7. Blogs Section containing my blogs on web development and programming<br />
<br />
...and a lot more!<br />

Let's see how long does it takes. Hopefully, I resume this project as soon as possible and update it here!<br />

Till then, bye bye!<br />

Have a great life!!<br />
